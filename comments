=============
1. Just read your summary at 5/31. It covered a lot. The competition on data mining is pretty good to help you strengthen your skills. 
The first two are much easier and pretty common. The last one probably requires prior knowledge on complex language models. 
2. The website is running, but there is only a welcome message.
3. Can you try some example competitions form kaggle.com. That should give you a lot to practice. There could be something similar
from a chinese website.
